Chill VR

Chill VR is a virtual reality application developed in Unity that focuses on relaxation, immersion, and anxiety relief. The project is designed as a calm, customizable VR experience where users can control environmental sounds and atmosphere in a cozy virtual space.

This project is both a functional VR application and a portfolio piece showcasing Unity, C#, and VR interaction skills.

Project Overview

Chill VR places the user inside a cozy, dimly lit bedroom with a large glass wall overlooking a rainy forest at night. The environment is designed to feel safe, calm, and immersive, using soft lighting, ambient sound layers, and minimal interaction to promote relaxation.

Users interact with a floating VR menu that allows them to control individual sound layers in real time, creating a personalized relaxation experience.

Features

Fully immersive VR environment built with Unity

World-space VR menu with interactive sliders

Individual volume control for ambient sounds:

Purpose

The main goal of this project is to explore immersive VR design focused on relaxation while building a strong portfolio project. Relax VR demonstrates practical experience in:

VR UI design

Audio systems using AudioMixer

XR interaction workflows

Scene composition and atmosphere design

Writing clean, modular C# code for VR applications

Status

This project is currently in active development. Core systems such as the VR audio menu and environment setup are implemented, with additional scenes and features planned for future updates.
